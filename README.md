# NOTICE

rules_protobuf was initially written when the bazel protobuf ecosystem was
fairly immature.  Now 2 years later, this repository is showing its age.  Rather
than retrofit this set of rules, it's been re-written from the ground-up to work
correctly with the `native.proto_library` rule and is available at
https://github.com/stackb/rules_proto.  Consequently, these rules are effectively
no longer being maintained.

Please upgrade to the newer rules when appropriate and file issues if there are
feature gaps that need to be filled.

Cheers, @pcj (Oct 25 2018)

### How is this related to the proto\_library rules within Bazel itself?

These rules sprung out of a need to have protobuf support when there
was limited exposed and documented proto generation capabilities in
the main bazel repository.  This is a moving target.  The main goals
of this project are to:

1. Provide `protoc`, the protocol buffer compiler
   ([v3.5.1](https://github.com/google/protobuf/commit/1f8b9b202e9a4e467ff0b0f25facb1642727cdf5e69092038f15b37c75b99e45)).

2. Provide the language-specific plugins.

3. Provide the necessary libraries and dependencies for gRPC support,
   when possible.

4. Provide an extensible `proto_language` abstraction (used in
   conjunction with the `proto_compile` rule) to generate outputs for
   current and future custom protoc plugins not explicitly provided
   here.

1. Support for generation of protoc outputs via `proto_compile()`
   rule.

2. Support for generation + compilation of outputs with protobuf
   dependencies.

3. gRPC support.

4. Highly experimental (probably not functional yet). A
   work-in-progress for those interested in contributing further work.


# Usage

## 1. Install Bazel

If you have not already installed `bazel` on your workstation, follow
the [bazel instructions][bazel-install].

> NOTE: Bazel 0.8.0 or above is required for go support.

## 2. Add rules_protobuf your WORKSPACE

Specify the language(s) you'd like use by loading the
language-specific `*_proto_repositories` rule(s):

```python
git_repository(
  name = "org_pubref_rules_protobuf",
  remote = "https://github.com/pubref/rules_protobuf",
  tag = "v0.8.2",
  #commit = "..." # alternatively, use latest commit on master
)

load("@org_pubref_rules_protobuf//java:rules.bzl", "java_proto_repositories")
java_proto_repositories()

load("@org_pubref_rules_protobuf//cpp:rules.bzl", "cpp_proto_repositories")
cpp_proto_repositories()

load("@org_pubref_rules_protobuf//go:rules.bzl", "go_proto_repositories")
go_proto_repositories()
```

Several languages have other `rules_*` dependencies that you'll need
to load before the `*_proto_repositories()` function is invoked:

| Language | Requires |
| ---:     | :---     |
| closure_proto_repositories | [rules_closure](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_closure) |
| csharp_proto_repositories | [rules_dotnet](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_dotnet) |
| go_proto_repositories | [rules_go](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go) |
| gogo_proto_repositories | [rules_go](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go) |
| grpc_gateway_proto_repositories | [rules_go](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go) |
| node_proto_repositories | [rules_node](https://github.com/pubref/rules_node) |
| py_proto_repositories <sup>1</sup> | [rules_python](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python) |

> <sup>1</sup> Only needed for python grpc support.

## 3. Add \*\_proto\_\* rules to your BUILD files

To build a java-based gRPC library:

```python
load("@org_pubref_rules_protobuf//java:rules.bzl", "java_proto_library")

java_proto_library(
  name = "protolib",
  protos = [
    "my.proto"
  ],
  with_grpc = True,
  verbose = 1, # 0=no output, 1=show protoc command, 2+ more...
)
```

## Examples

To run the examples & tests in this repository, clone it to your
workstation.

```sh
# Clone this repo
$ git clone https://github.com/pubref/rules_protobuf

# Go to examples/helloworld directory
$ cd rules_protobuf/examples/helloworld

# Run all tests
$ bazel test examples/...

# Build a server
$ bazel build cpp/server

# Run a server from the command-line
$ $(bazel info bazel-bin)/examples/helloworld/cpp/server

# Run a client
$ bazel run go/client
$ bazel run cpp/client
$ bazel run java/org/pubref/rules_protobuf/examples/helloworld/client:netty
```

# Overriding or excluding WORKSPACE dependencies

To load alternate versions of dependencies, pass in a
[dict][skylark-dict] having the same overall structure of a
[deps.bzl](protobuf/deps.bzl) file.  Entries having a matching key will
override those found in the file.  For example, to load a different
version of https://github.com/golang/protobuf, provide a different
commit ID:

```python
load("@org_pubref_rules_protobuf//go:rules.bzl", "go_proto_repositories")
go_proto_repositories(
  overrides = {
    "com_github_golang_protobuf": {
      # Override golang with a different commit
      "commit": "2c1988e8c18d14b142c0b472624f71647cf39adb",
    }
  },
)
```

You may already have some external dependencies already present in
your workspace that rules_protobuf will attempt to load, causing a
collision.  To prevent rules_protobuf from loading specific external
workspaces, name them in the `excludes` list:

```python
go_proto_repositories(
  excludes = [
    "com_github_golang_glog",
  ]
)
```

To completely replace the set of dependencies that will attempt to be
loaded, you can pass in a full `dict` object to the `lang_deps`
attribute.

```python
go_proto_repositories(
  lang_deps = {
    "com_github_golang_glog": {
      ...
    },
  },
)
```

There are several language --> language dependencies as well. For
example, `python_proto_repositories` and `ruby_proto_repositories`
(and more) internally call the `cpp_proto_repositories` rule to
provide the grpc plugins.  To suppress this (and have better control
in your workspace), you can use the `omit_cpp_repositories=True`
option.

# Proto B --> Proto A dependencies

Use the `proto_deps` attribute to name proto rule dependencies. Use of
`proto_deps` implies you're using imports, so read on...

## Imports

In all cases, these rules will include a `--proto_path=.` (`-I.`)
argument.  This is functionally equivalent to `--proto_path=$(bazel
info execution_root)`.  Therefore, when the protoc tool is invoked, it
will 'see' whatever directory structure exists at the bazel execution
root for your workspace.  To better learn what this looks like, `cd
$(bazel info execution_root)` and look around.  In general, it
contains all your sourcefiles as they appear in your workspace with an
additional `external/WORKSPACE_NAME` directory for all dependencies
used.

This has implications for import statements in your protobuf
sourcefiles, if you use them.  The two cases to consider are imports
*within* your workspace (referred to here as *'internal' imports*),
and imports of other protobuf files in an external workspace
(*external imports*).

### Internal Imports

Internal imports should require no additional parameters if your
import statements follow the same directory structure of your
workspace.  For example, the
`examples/helloworld/proto/helloworld.proto` file imports the
`examples/proto/common.proto` file.  Since this matches the workspace
directory structure, `protoc` can find it, and no additional arguments
to a `cc_proto_library` are required for protoc code generation step.

Obviously, importing a file does not mean that code will be generated
for it.  Therefore, *use of the imports attribute implies that the
generated files for the imported message or service already exist
somewhere that can be used as a dependency some other library rule*
(such as `srcs` for `java_library`).

Rather than using `imports`, it often make more sense to declare a
dependency on another proto_library rule via the `proto_deps`
attribute.  This makes the import available to the calling rule and
performs the code generation step.  For example, the
`cc_proto_library` rule in `examples/helloworld/proto:cpp` names the
`//examples/proto:cpp`'s `cc_proto_library` rule in its `proto_deps`
attribute to accomplish both code generation and compilation of object
files for the proto chain.

### External Imports

The same logic applies to external imports.  The two questions to ask
yourself when setting up your rules are:

[Question 1]: *Can protoc "see" the imported file?* In order to satisfy this
requirement, pass in the full path of the required file(s) relative to
the execution root where protoc will be run.  For example, the
well-known `descriptor.proto` could be made visible to protoc via:

```python
java_proto_library(
  name = 'fooprotos',
  protos = 'foo.proto`,
  imports = [
      "external/com_google_protobuf/src/",
    ],
    inputs = [
      "@com_google_protobuf//:well_known_protos",
    ],
)
```

This would be imported as `import "google/protobuf/descriptor.proto"`
given that the file
`@com_google_protobuf/src/google/protobuf/descriptor.proto` is
in the package `google.protobuf`.

[Question 2]: *Can the `cc_proto_library` rule "see" the generated protobuf files*?
(in this case `descriptor.pb.{h,cc}`.  Just because the file was
imported does not imply that protoc will generate outputs for it, so
somewhere in the `cc_library` rule dependency chain these files must
be present.  This could be via another `cc_proto_library` rule defined
elswhere, or a some other filegroup or label list.  If the source is
another `cc_proto_library` rule, specify that in the `proto_deps`
attribute to the calling `cc_proto_library` rule.  Otherwise, pass a
label that includes the (pregenerated) protobuf files to the `deps`
attribute, just as you would any typical `cc_library` rule.

**Important note about sandboxing**: simply stating the path where
  protoc should look for imports (via the `imports` attribute) is not
  enough to work with the bazel sandbox.  Bazel is very particular
  about needing to know *exactly* which inputs are required for a
  rule, and *exactly* what output files it generates.  If an input is
  not declared, it will not be exposed in the sandbox.  Therefore, we
  have to provide both the import path *and* a label-generating rule
  in the `inputs` attribute that names the files we want available in
  the sandbox (given here by `:well_known_protos`).

If you are having problems, put `verbose={1,2,3}` in your build rule
and/or disable sandboxing with `--spawn_strategy=standalone`.
